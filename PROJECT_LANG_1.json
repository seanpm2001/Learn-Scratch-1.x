{"About:"}
{"I decided to make Scratch 1.x the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Scratch-1.x) as Scratch (1.x) is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Scratch (1.x) programming language. It only makes sense to Scratch 1.x the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
